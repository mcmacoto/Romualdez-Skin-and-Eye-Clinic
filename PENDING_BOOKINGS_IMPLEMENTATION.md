# Pending Bookings Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete pending bookings workflow system that allows staff to review, accept, or decline booking requests before they are confirmed. This feature ensures healthcare compliance by requiring staff verification before appointments are finalized.

## Implementation Date
January 2025

## Feature Description
The pending bookings management system allows staff members to:
- View all bookings with "Pending" status
- Review patient information, requested service, and appointment details
- Accept bookings (which triggers patient record creation and confirmation)
- Decline bookings (which cancels the booking request)
- View patient notes for context

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend - URL Routes (`bookings/urls_v2.py`)
**Added 3 new routes:**
```python
# Pending Bookings HTMX endpoints
path('htmx/pending-bookings/', views_v2.htmx_pending_bookings, name='htmx_pending_bookings'),
path('htmx/accept-booking/<int:booking_id>/', views_v2.htmx_accept_booking, name='htmx_accept_booking'),
path('htmx/decline-booking/<int:booking_id>/', views_v2.htmx_decline_booking, name='htmx_decline_booking'),
```

### 2. Backend - View Functions (`bookings/views_v2.py`)

#### a) `htmx_pending_bookings(request)` (Lines 820-835)
- **Purpose**: List all pending bookings
- **Method**: GET
- **Access**: Staff only (`@login_required`, staff check)
- **Query**: `Booking.objects.filter(status='Pending').order_by('date', 'time')`
- **Returns**: HTML partial (`pending_bookings.html`)

#### b) `htmx_accept_booking(request, booking_id)` (Lines 838-870)
- **Purpose**: Accept a pending booking and confirm the appointment
- **Method**: POST
- **Access**: Staff only
- **Process**:
  1. Validates booking exists and has "Pending" status
  2. Updates `booking.status = 'Confirmed'`
  3. Saves booking (triggers Django signals)
  4. Signals automatically create:
     - Patient record
     - Medical record
     - Billing record
  5. Returns success message with auto-remove JavaScript
- **Returns**: HTML with success notification and row removal script

#### c) `htmx_decline_booking(request, booking_id)` (Lines 873-905)
- **Purpose**: Decline/cancel a pending booking
- **Method**: POST
- **Access**: Staff only
- **Process**:
  1. Validates booking exists and has "Pending" status
  2. Updates `booking.status = 'Cancelled'`
  3. Saves booking
  4. Returns warning message with auto-remove JavaScript
- **Returns**: HTML with warning notification and row removal script

### 3. Frontend - Pending Bookings Table (`bookings/templates/bookings_v2/htmx_partials/pending_bookings.html`)

**Template Structure** (130 lines):

#### Table Columns:
1. Patient Name
2. Contact Information (Email & Phone)
3. Service
4. Date
5. Time
6. Status Badge
7. Actions (Accept, Decline, View Notes)

#### Features:
- **Accept Button** (Green):
  - Icon: Check circle
  - Confirmation: "Are you sure you want to accept this booking?"
  - Action: `hx-post="{% url 'bookings_v2:htmx_accept_booking' booking.id %}"`
  - Target: `#booking-row-{{ booking.id }}`
  - Swap: `outerHTML` (replaces entire row)

- **Decline Button** (Red):
  - Icon: Times circle
  - Confirmation: "Are you sure you want to decline this booking?"
  - Action: `hx-post="{% url 'bookings_v2:htmx_decline_booking' booking.id %}"`
  - Target: `#booking-row-{{ booking.id }}`
  - Swap: `outerHTML`

- **View Notes Button** (Blue):
  - Icon: Eye
  - Action: Toggle collapse for patient notes
  - Shows/hides collapsible row with patient notes

#### Auto-Remove Behavior:

### 4. Frontend - Admin Dashboard Integration (`bookings/templates/bookings_v2/admin_dashboard_v2.html`)

#### a) Quick Actions Button (Lines 533-541)
Added "Pending Bookings" button in the Quick Actions grid:
```html
<button type="button" class="quick-action-btn" 
        hx-get="{% url 'bookings_v2:htmx_pending_bookings' %}" 
        hx-target="#pendingBookingsContainer"
        data-bs-toggle="modal" 
        data-bs-target="#pendingBookingsModal">
    <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
    <span>Pending Bookings</span>
</button>
```

#### b) Pending Bookings Modal (Lines 848-883)
Full-screen modal for managing pending bookings:
- **Header**: Title with clock icon, close button
- **Body**:
  - Instructional text explaining the workflow
  - Refresh button to reload the list
  - Container for HTMX content (`#pendingBookingsContainer`)
- **Loading State**: Spinner with "Loading pending bookings..." text
- **Size**: Extra Large (`modal-xl`) for full table display

#### c) Stat Card Update (Lines 373-381)
Updated the "Pending Bookings" stat card to open the new modal:
- **Before**: Opened appointments modal with filter
- **After**: Opens dedicated pending bookings modal
- **Trigger**: Click on stat card
- **Target**: `#pendingBookingsContainer`
- **Modal**: `#pendingBookingsModal`
- **Hint**: "Click to manage"

## User Workflow

### Patient Perspective:
1. Patient submits booking through public booking form
2. Booking is created with `status='Pending'`
3. Patient is redirected to success page showing booking details
4. Patient waits for staff confirmation

### Staff Perspective:
1. Staff logs into admin dashboard
2. Sees "Pending Bookings" count in stats (orange warning card)
3. Clicks on stat card OR "Pending Bookings" button in Quick Actions
4. Modal opens showing table of all pending bookings
5. Reviews patient information and notes
6. Clicks "Accept" to confirm booking:
   - Booking status changes to "Confirmed"
   - Patient record is automatically created
   - Medical record is created
   - Billing record is created
   - Success message appears
   - Row disappears after 2 seconds
7. OR clicks "Decline" to cancel booking:
   - Booking status changes to "Cancelled"
   - Warning message appears
   - Row disappears after 2 seconds

## Technical Implementation Details

### HTMX Usage:
- **hx-get**: Loads pending bookings list
- **hx-post**: Accepts or declines booking
- **hx-target**: Targets specific row for replacement
- **hx-swap**: Uses `outerHTML` to replace entire row
- **hx-confirm**: Browser confirmation before action
- **hx-trigger**: Click event triggers HTMX request

### Django Signals:
The existing signal system in `bookings/signals.py` automatically handles patient record creation:
```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=Booking)
def create_patient_on_booking_acceptance(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if instance.status == 'Confirmed' and not created:
        # Creates Patient, MedicalRecord, and Billing records
```

### Auto-Remove JavaScript:
```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
    const row = document.getElementById('booking-row-{{ booking.id }}');
    if (row) {
        row.style.transition = 'opacity 0.3s ease';
        row.style.opacity = '0';
        setTimeout(() => row.remove(), 300);
    }
}, 2000);
```

### Security:
- All endpoints require `@login_required` decorator
- Staff-only access enforced
- Booking validation prevents accepting already confirmed bookings
- Error handling for non-existent bookings

## Database Impact

### Queries:
1. **List Pending Bookings**: 
   - `SELECT * FROM bookings_booking WHERE status='Pending' ORDER BY date, time`
   
2. **Accept Booking**:
   - `UPDATE bookings_booking SET status='Confirmed' WHERE id=?`
   - Triggers signal → 3 INSERT queries (Patient, MedicalRecord, Billing)
   
3. **Decline Booking**:
   - `UPDATE bookings_booking SET status='Cancelled' WHERE id=?`

### Performance:
- All queries are indexed (status, date, time)
- Minimal database load
- Auto-remove reduces frontend re-renders

## Compatibility

### Browser Support:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support
- Firefox: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ✅ Full support

## Migration Notes

### From Original System:
- **Original**: `api_get_pending_bookings()` → JSON response
- **V2**: `htmx_pending_bookings()` → HTML partial
- **Original**: `api_accept_booking()` → JSON response
- **V2**: `htmx_accept_booking()` → HTML with auto-remove
- **Original**: `api_decline_booking()` → JSON response
- **V2**: `htmx_decline_booking()` → HTML with auto-remove

### Improvements Over Original:
1. Better UX with HTMX (no page refresh)
2. Auto-remove rows for immediate feedback
3. Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions
4. Integrated into admin dashboard (no separate page)
5. Collapsible notes for better space utilization
6. Responsive design for mobile access
7. Visual feedback with success/warning messages

## Related Features

### Booking Success Page:
After submitting a booking, users are redirected to `/v2/success/?booking_id=123` which shows:
- Confirmation message
- Booking details
- "What Happens Next" information
- Explains that staff will review the booking

### Signals Integration:
The pending bookings workflow integrates seamlessly with existing signals:
- `create_patient_on_booking_acceptance` (creates Patient record)
- `create_medical_record_for_patient` (creates MedicalRecord)
- `create_billing_for_appointment` (creates Billing record)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. Email notifications to patients when booking is accepted/declined
2. SMS notifications for appointment confirmation
3. Bulk accept/decline for multiple bookings
4. Filters for date range, service type, etc.
5. Export pending bookings to CSV/Excel
6. Booking notes/comments system for staff communication
7. Automatic decline after X days of no action
8. Patient portal showing pending booking status
