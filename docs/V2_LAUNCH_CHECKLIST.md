## 🚀 Ready for URL Swap

The V2 interface is now **production-ready** and can be made the primary interface.

### Current URLs
```
/ → bookings:landing (Public landing page)
/v2/ → bookings_v2:admin_dashboard (V2 Admin Dashboard)
/admin/ → Django Admin (Old interface)
```

### Recommended URL Structure (Post-Swap)
```
/ → bookings:landing (Public landing page)
/admin/ → bookings_v2:admin_dashboard (V2 as primary)
/old-admin/ → Django Admin (Deprecated, with notice)
```

### 2. URL Swap (10 minutes)

**File to Edit**: `clinic/urls.py`

**Current Configuration**:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  # Django admin
    path('v2/', include('bookings.urls_v2')),  # V2 interface
    path('', include('bookings.urls')),  # Public pages
]
```

**New Configuration**:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', include('bookings.urls_v2')),  # V2 as primary
    path('old-admin/', admin.site.urls),  # Django admin (deprecated)
    path('', include('bookings.urls')),  # Public pages
]
```

**Steps**:
1. Open `clinic/clinic/urls.py`
2. Swap the paths as shown above
3. Save the file
4. Restart the Django server: `python manage.py runserver`

### 3. Add Deprecation Notice to Old Admin (5 minutes)

**File to Edit**: `clinic/templates/admin/base_site.html`

Add this banner at the top:
```html
<div style="background: #ffc107; color: #000; padding: 15px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    ⚠️ This admin interface is deprecated. Please use the <a href="/admin/" style="color: #0066cc;">new V2 interface</a>.
</div>
```

### 4. Update Landing Page Links (5 minutes)

**File to Edit**: `clinic/bookings/templates/bookings/landing.html`

Find the staff login button and update the link:
```html
<!-- Change from -->
<a href="{% url 'bookings_v2:staff_login' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Staff Login</a>

<!-- To -->
<a href="{% url 'bookings_v2:staff_login' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Staff Login</a>
<!-- (Should already be correct) -->
```

    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  # Django admin (restored)
    path('v2/', include('bookings.urls_v2')),  # V2 (back to /v2/)
    path('', include('bookings.urls')),  # Public pages
]
```

**2. Restart server**:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**3. Communicate to staff**:
"We've temporarily restored the old admin interface while we address some issues. Please use `/admin/` instead of `/v2/` for now."
