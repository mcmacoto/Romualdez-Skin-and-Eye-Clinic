# Bootstrap Primary Color Override - Blue to Green

## Issue
All Bootstrap `bg-primary` and `text-primary` classes were showing as **blue** instead of **green** across the V2 interface, particularly noticeable on:
- About page header
- About page section titles ("Our Mission", "Why Choose Us?", "Our Journey")
- Icon backgrounds
- Service search bar
- Various headings throughout the site

## Root Cause
Bootstrap 5.3.2 has a default primary color of blue (`#0d6efd`). While `custom_v2.css` defined custom `--primary-color` variables as green, it didn't override Bootstrap's native utility classes (`.bg-primary`, `.text-primary`, etc.).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `v2_design_enhancements.css`
Added comprehensive Bootstrap primary color overrides at the top of the file:

```css
/* Override Bootstrap's blue primary color with green */
.bg-primary {
    background-color: #3d5c3d !important;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #3d5c3d 0%, #2c5f2d 100%) !important;
}

.text-primary {
    color: #3d5c3d !important;
}

.btn-primary {
    background-color: #3d5c3d !important;
    border-color: #3d5c3d !important;
}

.btn-primary:hover,
.btn-primary:focus,
.btn-primary:active {
    background-color: #2c5f2d !important;
    border-color: #2c5f2d !important;
}

.btn-outline-primary {
    color: #3d5c3d !important;
    border-color: #3d5c3d !important;
}

.btn-outline-primary:hover {
    background-color: #3d5c3d !important;
    color: #ffffff !important;
}

.border-primary {
    border-color: #3d5c3d !important;
}

.badge.bg-primary {
    background-color: #3d5c3d !important;
}
```

### 2. Updated `custom_v2.css`
Added Bootstrap variable overrides to `:root`:

```css
:root {
    /* Primary Brand Colors */
    --primary-color: #3d5c3d;
    --primary-dark: #2c5f2d;
    --primary-light: #5a7c5a;
    --primary-lighter: #7a9c7a;
    
    /* Bootstrap Variable Overrides - Force green as primary */
    --bs-primary: #3d5c3d;
    --bs-primary-rgb: 61, 92, 61;
    
    /* ... rest of variables ... */
}
```

### 3. Fixed POS Product Grid
Changed hard-coded blue border color to green:

**File:** `partials/pos_product_grid.html`

```css
/* BEFORE */
.product-card:hover:not(.out-of-stock) {
    border-color: #0d6efd;  /* Blue */
}

/* AFTER */
.product-card:hover:not(.out-of-stock) {
    border-color: #3d5c3d;  /* Green */
}
```

- Info badges (`bg-info` class) - Cyan/teal for information
- Male gender icons - Blue as conventional gender indicator
- Info icons on cards - Blue for informational context
- Secondary action buttons - May use other color schemes
